### First Art Piece

Screen capture taken from video “Presence 5.2”.

The new media piece that caught my attention was “Presence” lead by creative director Matt Pyke. It was created by using motion capture technology to record the movements of choreographed dancers, then artistically rendering the data using different methods. It was displayed in The Science Museum in London. The method that interested me most was the one in the screen capture above (and in the video linked in the bibliography). It depicted the two people as graphs of points, whose points sometimes connected across space to each others’. It was interesting to me to see how one could depict a series of points as a person’s form, and make it make sense in 3D space embedded on a 2D screen. Furthermore, it highlights the connects between the two dancers. Examining connection through movement, passion, and human essence is someone I want to research in my own work. How and why do people love? How can we help each other grow? What are the ways in which people connect? How do people nurture their connections? How can we utilize technology to provide space for positive and radical health, growth, and love? This is why I was immediately drawn to this piece out of all of the others.

### Second Art Piece

Screen capture taken from video “Interactive liquid cubes".

This piece is by Vincent Houze, where one moves their hand in front of the screen,and depending on the vertical position of your hand, it changes the effect of gravity on the particles flowing down the field. I am unsure if it was ever shown publicly. This is interesting to me because I don't have any skills pertaining to particle animation. Plus, I appreciate interactive media that encourages play and invokes a feeling of control and fascination in the audience. I wonder how they are tracking where the interacter's hand is in respect to the background, and what parameters there are for detecting vertical hand movemnet. I also wonder if one could move their hand in more directions, and that would also affect the movement of the particles.

### Third Art Piece

![FIELD](images/Picture 3.png?raw=true "FIELD")
Screen capture taken from video “Photon - Interactive Light Games".

This piece is by FIELD, and shown publicly at the Lumiere Festival of Lights in Durham in 2009 (presumably, the one in the UK, since FIELD Studio is in London). People can walk over the display of colorful lights raining down the sidewalk, and whereever they step, the lights splash away from them. I enjoy this piece because it is also playful, and I appreciate any art piece that brings joy to people's day. This is available to most people who can move through that space, bringing a new fun activity to them. I wonder if they are using projection mapping to project the images down onto the ground, because I can't see what their set-up is from the video.
