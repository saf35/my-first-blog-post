Screen capture taken from video “Presence 5.2”.

The new media piece that caught my attention was “Presence” lead by creative director Matt Pyke. It was created by using motion capture technology to record the movements of choreographed dancers, then artistically rendering the data using different methods. It was displayed in The Science Museum in London. The method that interested me most was the one in the screen capture above (and in the video linked in the bibliography). It depicted the two people as graphs of points, whose points sometimes connected across space to each others’. It was interesting to me to see how one could depict a series of points as a person’s form, and make it make sense in 3D space embedded on a 2D screen. Furthermore, it highlights the connects between the two dancers. Examining connection through movement, passion, and human essence is someone I want to research in my own work. How and why do people love? How can we help each other grow? What are the ways in which people connect? How do people nurture their connections? How can we utilize technology to provide space for positive and radical health, growth, and love? This is why I was immediately drawn to this piece out of all of the others.
